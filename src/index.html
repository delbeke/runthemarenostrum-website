        Mare Nostrum is the longest relay run ever, covering all European shores.
        <br /> It’s a journey of co-creation that will be ran by teams covering 100km each. We invite each team to pick a Stage
        and contribute to this unforgettable adventure.
        <br /> If you do, you’ll start running at 7 a.m. on a day and place of your choice from a designated list, taking a symbol
        that will travel the entire coast and will be passed on from team to team. You have to reach the end of your Stage
        within 24 hours where you will hand over the symbol to the other team.

          We will travel incredible places along our coastal journey. We will document all that beauty in one book.
        </div>
        <div>
          The book will be a visual travel guide for hikers, road trippers and culture lovers, written by your footsteps.
        </div>
        <div>
          As the road is long and the bucket of beauty plenty, we will write a serie of books. 
          The first one is already in the making and will document the coast from Knokke, the fancy hub at the Dutch / Belgian border - and San-Sebastian, the Basque gastronomic capital close to the French / Spanish border. 
          Our Kickstarter campaign was launched in December and raised 25.000 euro for publication estimated in Summer 2021.

        <div>
          Being part of a movement, we want to co-inspire and support three charitable pillars.
          <br /> The first pillar is helping physically disabled people. We want to show limits can be pushed.
        </div>
        <div>
          The second pillar is fighting mental challenges &amp; prevention of suicide. We want to be a source
          of inspiration and create collective energy to fight hopelessness.
        </div>
        <div>
          The third pillar is stopping plastic littering in sea &amp; oceans. We want to show the endless
          treasure nature has given us and clean-up beaches.

          Every 10km the contestants take a picture of the mini-figure and the shore to create a beautiful and unique book mapping
          our route and showing all the extraordinary places.
        </div>
        <div>
          Hundreds of unknown harbours, cliffs, lighthouses, villages, romantic bays or idyllic fjords will be captured. The figure
          will travel the whole coast but its shirt will be custom to the stage showing the stage number and specific, local
          attributes will be joined to create a book that is both creating the illusion the same mini-figure traveled the
          whole shore as establishing a personal and local touch.

      <div>The idea would stay an empty shell without your courage and commitment, engaging yourself to completing 100km. We are
