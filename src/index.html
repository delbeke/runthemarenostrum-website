                Mare Nostrum is the longest relay run ever, covering all European shores. It’s a journey of co-creation that will be ran
                by teams covering 100km each. We invite each team to pick a stage. You’ll start running at 7 a.m. on a designated
                day and place. You have to reach the end of your stage within 24 hours where you will hand over the relay
                batton to the other team.

                    Being part of a movement, we want to co-inspire and support three charitable pillars. The first pillar - legs of the figure
                    - is helping physically disabled people. We want to show limits can be pushed.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The second pillar - the head of the figure is fighting mental challenges &amp; prevention of suicide. We want to be a source
                    of inspiration and create collective energy to fight hopelessness.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The third pillar - the plastic of the figure - is stopping plastic littering in sea &amp; oceans. We want to show the endless
                    treasure nature Has given us and clean-up beaches.

                    local attributes will be joined to create a book that is both creating the illusion the same mini-figure
