        Follow the Coast is the longest relay run ever, covering all European shores. 
        It’s a journey of co-creation that will be ran by teams covering 100km each. We invite each team to pick a Stage and contribute to this unforgettable adventure. 
        If you do, you’ll start running at 7 a.m. on the day of your stage, forming the connection between the team that ran the stage before and after yours. 
        Together we run and co-write the story of the entire European coastline. 
        You have to reach the end of your Stage within 24 hours where the next team takes over to continue the journey.

          We will travel incredible places along our coastal journey. We will document all that beauty in one book.
        </div>
        <div>
          The book will be a visual travel guide for hikers, road trippers and culture lovers, written by your footsteps.
        </div>
        <div>
          As the road is long and the bucket of beauty plenty, we will write a serie of books. 
          The first one documents the entire coastline from Knokke to San-Sebastian, the Basque gastronomic capital close to the French - Spanish border. 
          Our second book covers the entire northern and western coast of the Iberic Peninsula, from San Sebastián to Gibraltar. 
          You can buy these books <a href="/thebook/">here</a>. Our third book will document Gibraltar to Monaco and the fourth will tell the story of the entire Italian coastline!

          Being part of a movement, we want to co-inspire and support three charitable pillars.
          <br /> The first pillar is helping physically disabled people. We want to show limits can be pushed.
        </div>
        <div>
          The second pillar is fighting mental challenges &amp; prevention of suicide. We want to be a source
          of inspiration and create collective energy to fight hopelessness.
        </div>
        <div>
          The third pillar is stopping plastic littering in sea &amp; oceans. We want to show the endless
          treasure nature has given us and clean-up beaches.

          We follow the runners with photographers and support them on their journey. 
          We capture the beauty of all the extraordinary places we encounter to showcase in our books. 
          Hundreds of unknown harbours, cliffs, lighthouses, villages, romantic bays or idyllic fjords will be captured. 
          By traveling the entire coastline, we will be able to tell the story of slowly changing geography, interesting history and local highlights, creating a never before told story in a wonderful encyclopedia-format.
