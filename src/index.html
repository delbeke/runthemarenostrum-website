      <div class='description'>
        Mare Nostrum is the longest relay run ever, covering all European shores.
        <br /> It’s a journey of co-creation that will be ran by teams covering 100km each. We invite each team to pick a Stage
        and contribute to this unforgettable adventure.
        <br /> If you do, you’ll start running at 7 a.m. on a day and place of your choice from a designated list, taking a symbol
        that will travel the entire coast and will be passed on from team to team. You have to reach the end of your Stage
        within 24 hours where you will hand over the symbol to the other team.

          A symbol of the project will be passed on from team to team travelling the whole traject.
        </div>
        <div>
          This symbol will be an hourglass. In Dutch - the language of the starting point - ‘hourglass’ is translated to ‘sand runner’
          as the sand literally runs from one part to the other. Like the sand running from one place to another, we will
          run from A to B.
        </div>
        <div>
          During each Stage each team will add local sand particles to the symbol co-creating an hourglass that will contain sand of
          every piece of beach in Europe. Travelling the European shores we will encounter magnificent places. To capture
          this immense beauty each team will take a picture of the symbol every 10k. The end goal is to co-create a unique
          book &amp; collection co-written by thousands of people.

        <div>
          Being part of a movement, we want to co-inspire and support three charitable pillars.
          <br /> The first pillar - legs of the figure - is helping physically disabled people. We want to show limits can be pushed.
        </div>
        <div>
          The second pillar - the head of the figure is fighting mental challenges &amp; prevention of suicide. We want to be a source
          of inspiration and create collective energy to fight hopelessness.
        </div>
        <div>
          The third pillar - the plastic of the figure - is stopping plastic littering in sea &amp; oceans. We want to show the endless
          treasure nature has given us and clean-up beaches.

          Every 10km the contestants take a picture of the mini-figure and the shore to create a beautiful and unique book mapping
          our route and showing all the extraordinary places.
        </div>
        <div>
          Hundreds of unknown harbours, cliffs, lighthouses, villages, romantic bays or idyllic fjords will be captured. The figure
          will travel the whole coast but its shirt will be custom to the stage showing the stage number and specific, local
          attributes will be joined to create a book that is both creating the illusion the same mini-figure traveled the
          whole shore as establishing a personal and local touch.
